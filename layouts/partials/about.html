        <p>I'm a holistic coach experienced in developing tailored training and nutrition solutions to help you achieve a thriving healthy lifestyle.</p>

        <p>For the past 20 years, Iâ€™ve been an aerialist, a yoga teacher, a handstands practitioner, a gym rat, a vegetarian, a vegan (very very briefly), and a protein junkie.</p>
            
        <p>I have been an entrepreneur for over 10 years. I founded my own company in Amsterdam leading group classes for kids and adults, workshops, and consulting for circus companies around Europe, USA, and Norway.</p>
        
        <p>I recently co-founded my coaching app in Singapore where I run my personal trainer practice.  I'm also a Milan Pole Dance Studio coach for group and private aerial, mobility, and conditioning classes.</p>

        <p>Through my own trial and error and the experiences I collected from my students and clients, I learned to combine the best of the many disciplines, training methods, diets, and habits to optimize a healthy lifestyle that fits you and your unique routine.</p>

        <p>I specialize in:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Strength and resistance training</li>
            <li>Mobility and flexibility</li>
            <li>Nutrition Coaching</li>
            <li>Habit and Lifestyle Coaching</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I work side by side with my clients making every decision together and learning to pivot and adapt as we progress towards our goals.</p>
