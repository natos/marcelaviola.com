### Aerial silks and hoop weekly classes

Aerial training for beginners and intermediate.

The class presents a warm up based in yoga to achieve concentration, body awareness and greater active flexibility. Later, in the aerial elements, the specific technique, conditioning, performance and creativity are developed by combining the qualities of both disciplines.

The class ends with stretching and relaxation exercises.

### Yoga classes

Back in 2011, I finished my yoga Purna Yoga teacher's training at the International Yoga Federation in Argentina in Buenos Aires and before that, I also studied Iyengar Yoga. Later on, I followed a few Acro yoga workshops in Argentina and Amsterdam and I also did some study over Okido yoga, acupressure and massage. I'm an active yoga practitioner and I love to be a student and to practice Vinyasa on a regular basis.

This wide range of knowledge gives me the tools to adapt the class to each student.

I currently teach weekly classes of Artistic Yoga at Pole Dance Factory Amsterdam on Fridays afternoon. I'm also available for private classes and group classes on demand. [Get in touch](/contact)

### Flexibility classes

Flexibility is important in everybody's life, it helps to keep you movable, increase the range of motion and prevent injuries.

The class begins with a warm-up based on yoga and dance elements. Then we move on to work on your personal flexibility needs and goals.

I focus on your alignment, posture corrections, and fine details. We use yoga props to help you find space and stability in each position and to increase the range of motion.
The program includes basic contortion coaching, flexibility for aerialist and therapeutic approach to recover from and to prevent injuries.

Also indicated for nonacrobats and office workers. All levels welcome, no preview experience or flexibility level are necessary. [Contact me to get a quote.](mailto:marcela.aerialist@gmail.com?subject=Contact%20from%20your%20website)
