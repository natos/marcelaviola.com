## Workshops

I give intensive weekend workshops once a month. With a wide range of themes from aerial technique to flexibility development, the intensive workshops are 2 to 3 hours long. The extra time gives the posiblity to go deeper into the choosen theme and a maximun of 10 students ensures the personal observation and focus on their particular needs.

Attention to detail and tailored guidance are my personal signature.
